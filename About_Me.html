    Welcome to my website! My name is Brayden neargarder. My interests have always drawn me to technology. Over the years I have always wanted a
    Screen in front of me. My love is for gaming and baseball, I am currently in the IT C.T.C programm through Kettering Fairmont Highschool.
    I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, and enjoy helping others when I can. I enjoy mostly keeping to myself or being with my friends.
    During my free time during the summer I do sports and work for my family, over the school year we are still very involved with family throughout 
    the year while still being free.</p>
